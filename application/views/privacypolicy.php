	<p id="privacybanner">HD Window Cleaning (HDWindows.ca) respects your privacy both online and off. What does that mean? It means when you tell us about yourself and give us
	sensitive information like your phone number or e-mail address, you can trust us that those details won't end up in the hands
	of spammers. It also means we value you as a customer more than we value selling your information. </p>

					We ask for your postal code when you begin a quote or booking. We use this postal code to check if you are in our service area, and discard it afterwards.
